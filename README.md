## Description 

This was my first time using Node.js and I tried making a little game as well.
Sadly, I don't really like it too much so I've abbondend it.

What I did create was a 2d collision engine which runs in the browser.
All collision logic was implemented (and worked on paper) by me, Pixi.js
is a dependency but it's used just for rendering.
