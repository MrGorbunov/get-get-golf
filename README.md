# Get Get Golf
This was my first time using Node.js and I tried making a little game as well.
Sadly, I don't really like it too much so I'm abondoning it :p

This still runs, and there are not npm dependencies to run (nodemon is a dev-dependency). Basically
just a golf game, but it was fun making a custom physics engine.
